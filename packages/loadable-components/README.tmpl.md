# loadable-components

## Config

```json
["loadable-components", {}]
```

Sometimes you need to wrap loadable with your own custom logic. There are many use cases for it, from injecting telemetry to hiding external libraries behind facade.
By default `loadable-components` are configured to transform dynamic imports used only inside loadable helpers, but can be configured to instrument any other function of your choice.
```json
["loadable-components", { "signatures": [
    {
        "from": "myLoadableWrapper",
        "name": "default" 
    },
    {
        "from": "myLoadableWrapper",
        "name": "lazy" 
    }]
}]
```
